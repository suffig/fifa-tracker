# FIFA Tracker - Supabase to Nhost Migration

## Migration Status: 95% Complete ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Created `nhostClient.js` with GraphQL wrapper for database operations
- Migrated authentication from Supabase Auth to Nhost Auth (`auth.js`)
- Updated core data access layer (`data.js`)
- Migrated realtime subscriptions from Supabase to Hasura GraphQL subscriptions (`main.js`)
- Updated connection monitoring for Nhost (`connectionMonitor.js`)
- Migrated all module files: `bans.js`, `finanzen.js`, `kader.js`, `spieler.js`, `stats.js`
- Updated test utilities (`test-db-connectivity.js`)
- Updated documentation to reflect Nhost architecture (`DATABASE_CONNECTIVITY.md`)
- Backed up original Supabase client (`supabaseClient.js.backup`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining:
- `matches.js` - Contains ~40 direct Supabase database calls that need to be migrated to Nhost GraphQL
  - This is the most complex module with intricate match saving, scoring, and financial logic
  - Requires careful migration of each database operation
  - All other functionality should work normally

### üöÄ Architecture Changes:
- **From**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **To**: Nhost (PostgreSQL + Hasura GraphQL + Nhost Auth + GraphQL Subscriptions)
- **Benefits**: Modern GraphQL API, better type safety, improved real-time subscriptions

### üîß Configuration:
- Nhost subdomain: `lclasfeqhdiqxycvumjm`
- Nhost region: `eu-central-1`
- Authentication: JWT-based with Nhost Auth
- Real-time: GraphQL subscriptions over WebSockets

### üìù Next Steps:
1. Complete matches.js migration by replacing remaining Supabase calls with Nhost GraphQL
2. Test all functionality end-to-end
3. Remove supabaseClient.js.backup when confident everything works
4. Update any additional configuration as needed

The app should be functional for all features except complex match operations that are in matches.js.
